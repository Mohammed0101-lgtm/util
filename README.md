## utilities 
Whether you are new to the C programming language or an expert , chances are you probably are writing too much boiler-plate code that does 'boring' yet necessary functionalities like reading text from stdin or removing and appending to arrays, this relatively small library has helper functions and utilities to make writing code in c much faster without wasting time in writing mundane stuff

### remember
  you almost always want to free your dynamically allocated memory after you're done with it, so if you use a string from 'get_string()' remember to free it!
